# HubSpot Credits — Infographic & Cost Calculator

This project renders the provided `hubspot-cost-calculator.tsx` component as a standalone web app using Vite + React + TypeScript with Tailwind CSS and lightweight UI primitives.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` — start dev server
- `npm run build` — production build
- `npm run preview` — preview build

## Notes
- The UI components in `src/components/ui/*` are minimal wrappers to match the design (Card, Button, Tabs, etc.).
- Tailwind scans the top-level `hubspot-cost-calculator.tsx` file directly.
