# **HubSpot Breeze AI & Credits: A Comprehensive FAQ**

This guide is designed to provide clear, comprehensive answers about HubSpot's Breeze AI tools and the associated credit-based pricing model. Our goal is to help you understand the fundamentals, plan your usage, and optimize how you leverage these powerful new features to drive growth and efficiency.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Understanding the Fundamentals**

This section covers the essential concepts of HubSpot's AI tools and credit system. Answering these foundational "what is" questions will provide the knowledge you need to understand how Breeze Agents, Assistants, and the credit model function together across the platform.

1. **What are HubSpot Credits?** HubSpot Credits are a flexible, cross-feature unit used to pay for usage-based features. They provide a simple and clear way to manage and plan your usage of these tools each month.  
2. **Do my monthly HubSpot Credits roll over to the next month?** No. Your included HubSpot Credits **reset monthly** during your subscription term and unused credits do not roll over into the following month.  
3. **What is HubSpot Breeze?** **Breeze** is HubSpot’s collection of AI tools, which are seamlessly integrated throughout the customer platform. This suite includes both AI-powered Agents and Assistants designed to enhance productivity and automate workflows.  
4. **What is the difference between a Breeze Agent and a Breeze Assistant?** The core distinction is their operational approach. **Breeze Assistants work *with* you** as collaborative partners to enhance human productivity, while **Breeze Agents work *for you* autonomously** to execute entire workflows independently.  
5. **How many credits are included with my HubSpot subscription?** The number of included credits is determined by the single highest-level product edition you own and are not added together if you own multiple products.

| Highest-Level Product Edition Group | Starter | Professional | Enterprise |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Smart CRM, Marketing, Sales, Service, & Content Hubs | **500** | **3,000** | **5,000** |
| Data Hub & Customer Platform\* | **500** | **5,000** | **10,000** |
| \*Customer Platform includes the Starter, Professional, or Enterprise edition of every HubSpot product, bundled together. |  |  |  |

1. **How much does it cost to buy more credits?** You can purchase additional capacity packs, which are sold in **1,000-credit** monthly units at a price of **$10 per pack** in USD.  
2. **What happens if I use more credits than I have?** If your usage exceeds your total credits, your account will either automatically upgrade to include the necessary number of additional capacity packs, or, if you have enabled it, you will incur per-credit overage fees at the end of the month. Note that capacity packs, once added, persist through the end of your term, while per-credit overages are billed only for the month in which they occur.  
3. **What is a "capacity pack"?** A "capacity pack" is a purchase that adds **1,000 additional HubSpot Credits** to your account per month. This is the default auto-upgrade path for exceeding your credit limit, with the alternative being the optional per-credit overage system.  
4. **What is the "per-credit overage" option?** This is an optional billing method you can enable *instead of* automatically upgrading with capacity packs. It bills you monthly for each credit used beyond your included amount at a rate of **$0.010 per credit** in USD. Invoices are issued in increments of 10 credits.  
5. **What is a "Breeze Agent"?** A **Breeze Agent** is a specialized, autonomous AI worker that executes specific tasks independently. Agents work in the background to save time and uncover opportunities, and are capable of handling complex, multi-step processes automatically without constant oversight.  
6. **Which specific Breeze features consume credits?** According to the confirmed rate sheet, features in the following categories consume credits: **Breeze Agents**, **Breeze Automation**, and **Buyer Intent**.  
7. **How much does a single handled conversation with the Customer Agent cost in credits?** A single handled conversation on **text-based channels** with the **Customer Agent** costs **100 credits**.  
8. **What is the credit cost for a Breeze action in a workflow?** Executing one Breeze action in a workflow costs **10 credits**.  
9. **Are all Breeze AI tools billed using credits?** No. While some **Breeze Agents** consume credits, other Breeze features, such as the **Breeze Assistant**, are included in the pricing for the products they are packaged in. Additionally, many agents currently in Beta do not yet have a published credit rate.  
10. **What are HubSpot Seats and how are they different from Credits?** A **"seat"** defines the level of access an individual user has to the subscription services and its features. In contrast, **"credits"** are used to purchase additional capacity for specific usage-based features across the platform.  
11. **Where can I find the official credit costs for different actions?** The **HubSpot Credits Rate Sheet** is the authoritative source for this information. It lists the specific number of credits consumed by individual features and actions, which allows you to estimate your usage accurately.

With these fundamentals established, the next section explores how to apply this knowledge to manage costs and use specific features effectively.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Practical Application and Management**

Moving from "what" to "how," this section focuses on the practical application of Breeze AI and credits. Here, we cover cost calculation, the mechanics of credit consumption, and step-by-step processes for some of the most popular autonomous agents.

1. **How do I calculate the total monthly cost if my usage exceeds my included credits?** There are two methods for calculating costs, depending on your account configuration. Let **`U`** be your Total Monthly Usage, and **`I`** be your Included Credits.  
   1. **Auto-Upgrading with Capacity Packs:**  
      1. Calculate overage credits: `Overage = U - I`  
      2. Determine packs needed (rounded up): `Packs = ⌈Overage / 1000⌉`  
      3. Calculate final cost: `Monthly Cost = Packs × $10`  
   2. **Billing via Per-Credit Overages:**  
      1. Calculate overage credits: `Overage = U - I`  
      2. Calculate final cost: `Monthly Cost = Overage × $0.010`  
2. **What is the difference in billing between "per action" and "per recurrence" credit consumption?**  
   1. **Per Action:** These features consume credits each time a specific event occurs. For example, a credit charge is applied for each conversation a Customer Agent handles or each time a Breeze action executes in a workflow.  
   2. **Per Recurrence:** These features consume credits upon activation and then again on a monthly basis for as long as the feature remains enabled.  
3. **How does the Prospecting Agent work, and what actions consume credits?** The Prospecting Agent automates the lead research and outreach process through the following steps:  
   1. Automatically scans your CRM for contacts matching target criteria.  
   2. Researches contacts using public data, social media, and company websites.  
   3. Analyzes recent company news, funding, and hiring patterns.  
   4. Generates detailed multi-page research reports broken into sections like founders, recent news, web traffic, and organic keywords.  
   5. Crafts personalized email sequences based on research findings.  
   6. Schedules and sends outreach emails at optimal times.  
   7. Monitors responses and adjusts follow-ups automatically.  
   8. Updates CRM records with all engagement data.  
4. This agent has two actions that consume credits:  
   1. **100 credits** to enable monthly monitoring of one contact.  
   2. **10 credits** for deep research on one company.  
5. **Can you provide a step-by-step example of the Customer Agent's support process?** The Customer Agent provides 24/7 automated support by executing this 8-step process:  
   1. Reads incoming chat and email inquiries in real-time.  
   2. Searches your knowledge base, blog content, and help documentation for answers.  
   3. Recognizes returning visitors by cross-referencing CRM data.  
   4. Provides instant, contextual responses tailored to the customer's history.  
   5. Qualifies leads by asking targeted questions.  
   6. Books meetings directly by accessing calendar availability.  
   7. Updates contact records with conversation summaries.  
   8. Routes complex inquiries to human agents with full context.

7. **Which specific Breeze Agents are currently in Beta but have a published credit rate?** The following beta features have a confirmed credit rate:  
   1. **Breeze Data Agent:** **10 credits** to generate a response to one prompt for one record.  
   2. **Data Studio:** **25, 75, or 200 credits** per sync, depending on whether the data source is small, medium, or large.  
8. **I own Marketing Hub Pro and Sales Hub Enterprise. How many included credits do I get?** Included credits are determined by the single highest-level edition you own across your products; they are not additive. Since Sales Hub Enterprise is a higher edition than Marketing Hub Professional, your account would receive **5,000 credits**.  
9. **How can I set a spending limit to control my costs?** Once you have configured your account for additional HubSpot Credits, an administrator can set a maximum monthly limit to cap spending and stay within budget.

Now that the practical application is clear, the final section addresses more advanced strategic and operational scenarios to help you maximize the value of Breeze and the credit system.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Strategic and Complex Scenarios**

These questions are for users looking to optimize their AI strategy, navigate complex multi-product environments, and understand the deeper business impact of deploying autonomous AI. This section explores how to make strategic decisions that align with your business goals.

1. **If I own Marketing Hub Professional and Data Hub Professional, how are my included credits calculated according to the "highest applicable inclusion" rule?** When you own both a main Hub (like Marketing, Sales, or Service Hub) and Data Hub, the highest applicable credit inclusion applies. Data Hub Professional includes **5,000 credits**, which is higher than the **3,000 credits** included with Marketing Hub Professional. Therefore, your account's total included credits would be **5,000**.  
2. **When should a business choose to deploy an autonomous Breeze Agent instead of using a collaborative Breeze Assistant?** The choice depends on your specific operational needs and goals. Use the following framework to guide your decision:  
   * **Deploy Agents when you need:**  
     * Autonomous task execution without human oversight.  
     * 24/7 operational capabilities.  
     * To scale capacity without increasing headcount.  
     * To handle high-volume, repetitive processes.  
   * **Deploy Assistants when you need:**  
     * To enhance human productivity and decision-making.  
     * A collaborative AI that learns organizational preferences.  
     * Task support that requires human judgment and interpretation.  
     * Content creation that maintains a specific brand voice and quality.  
3. **Can you provide a worked example of calculating costs for a company using the Customer Agent at scale, as shown in the documentation?** Certainly. Consider a company with a Professional Hub subscription that uses the **Customer Agent** to handle 120 conversations in a month.  
   * **Total Credits Used:** 120 conversations × 100 credits/conversation \= **12,000 credits**.  
   * **Included Credits:** A Professional subscription includes **3,000 credits**.  
   * **Overage Credits:** 12,000 (used) \- 3,000 (included) \= **9,000 credits**.  
4. From here, the cost is calculated based on the chosen billing path:  
   * **Capacity Pack Path:** 9,000 overage credits requires 9 capacity packs (at 1,000 credits each). The total cost would be 9 packs × $10/pack \= **$90**.  
   * **Optional Overage Path:** 9,000 overage credits are billed at the per-credit rate. The total cost would be 9,000 credits × $0.010/credit \= **$90**.  
5. **How can Breeze Agents uncover new revenue opportunities beyond just executing tasks?** Breeze Agents are designed to work in the background to uncover opportunities by analyzing patterns in your customer data. Key methods include:  
   * **Intent Signal Detection:** Agents can track when target accounts visit high-intent pages (like pricing or demos) or show increased activity (like hiring or funding), signaling they are ready to buy.  
   * **Revenue Expansion Opportunities:** By analyzing support tickets and product usage patterns, agents can identify customers who are approaching plan limits or asking about capabilities beyond their current plan, flagging them for upsell or cross-sell conversations.  
   * **Pipeline Acceleration Opportunities:** Agents can identify key decision-makers who are not yet engaged in a deal, track which prospects are actively consuming sales materials, and recognize when multiple meetings are being booked, all of which provide insights to help close deals faster.  
6. **What is the strategic advantage of HubSpot's unified platform for AI compared to using standalone AI tools?** The primary advantage is **connected data on a unified platform**. Because Breeze AI is built into HubSpot, it can leverage the full customer context—from marketing interactions and website visits to sales calls and service tickets. This creates a single source of truth, allowing AI to uncover patterns and deliver insights that are impossible to see in a disorganized tech stack with standalone tools operating on fragmented data.  
7. **My workload is highly volatile with unpredictable monthly spikes. Should I use capacity packs or enable overages?** For volatile workloads or short-term usage spikes, the recommended operational approach is to **enable per-credit overages with a spend cap**. This method allows you to pay only for what you use during a spike. It avoids committing to persistent capacity pack upgrades, which are a recurring monthly cost that remains through your subscription term even if usage decreases in subsequent months.  
8. **How does HubSpot's AI maturity model help organizations plan their AI adoption?** The model outlines a journey with four distinct phases to help organizations understand their current state and plan their next steps for AI adoption. The phases are:  
   * **AI-curious:** Just starting to explore AI tools and looking for quick wins.  
   * **Getting started:** Turning curiosity into coordinated action by adding AI to existing processes.  
   * **Building momentum:** Scaling AI by deeply weaving it into workflows to automate key tasks.  
   * **Leading the way:** Restructuring operations around AI capabilities to create a competitive advantage.  
9. **What are some concrete, measurable ROI indicators of a successful Breeze implementation?** Businesses have reported significant, measurable results from implementing Breeze AI, including:  
   * **Content production increases of 250%** (FBA case study)  
   * **Lead generation improvements of 216%** (FBA case study)  
   * **Revenue growth of 63%** (FBA case study)  
   * **Deal velocity increases of 20%** (Agicap case study)  
   * **Customer response time reductions of 34%** (ManoByte client)  
10. **Some Intelligence features state they "may consume HubSpot Credits." How should I plan for these costs?** The exact credit consumption for any feature is governed by the current, official **HubSpot Credits Rate Sheet** and the beta policy. For planning purposes, you must *only* reference the explicit rates published in the current HubSpot Credits Rate Sheet, as it is the sole authoritative source for all credit costs.  
11. **How do automated, bulk, and high-volume features impact credit consumption, and what is the recommended operational approach?** These types of features can consume credits at scale and accelerate your total usage within a monthly cycle. The recommended operational approach is to plan ahead by either purchasing the appropriate number of **capacity packs** or enabling **per-credit overages with a spending cap** to manage costs effectively.  
12. **What is the official policy regarding notice before a beta feature starts consuming credits?** HubSpot aims to provide at least **30 days’ notice** before a beta feature begins to consume credits. However, it is noted that this notice period may vary depending on the specific beta.
