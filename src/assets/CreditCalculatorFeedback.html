        <h1>HubSpot Breeze AI & Credits: A Comprehensive FAQ</h1>
        
        <div class="intro">
            This guide is designed to provide clear, comprehensive answers about HubSpot's Breeze AI tools and the associated credit-based pricing model. Our goal is to help you understand the fundamentals, plan your usage, and optimize how you leverage these powerful new features to drive growth and efficiency.

        <h2>Understanding the Fundamentals</h2>
        
        <div class="section-intro">
            This section covers the essential concepts of HubSpot's AI tools and credit system. Answering these foundational "what is" questions will provide the knowledge you need to understand how Breeze Agents, Assistants, and the credit model function together across the platform.
        </div>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <span class="question">What are HubSpot Credits?</span>
                <div class="answer">HubSpot Credits are a flexible, cross-feature unit used to pay for usage-based features. They provide a simple and clear way to manage and plan your usage of these tools each month.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">Do my monthly HubSpot Credits roll over to the next month?</span>
                <div class="answer">No. Your included HubSpot Credits <span class="highlight">reset monthly</span> during your subscription term and unused credits do not roll over into the following month.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">What is HubSpot Breeze?</span>
                <div class="answer"><strong>Breeze</strong> is HubSpot's collection of AI tools, which are seamlessly integrated throughout the customer platform. This suite includes both AI-powered Agents and Assistants designed to enhance productivity and automate workflows.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">What is the difference between a Breeze Agent and a Breeze Assistant?</span>
                <div class="answer">The core distinction is their operational approach. <strong>Breeze Assistants work <em>with</em> you</strong> as collaborative partners to enhance human productivity, while <strong>Breeze Agents work <em>for you</em> autonomously</strong> to execute entire workflows independently.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">How many credits are included with my HubSpot subscription?</span>
                <div class="answer">The number of included credits is determined by the single highest-level product edition you own and are not added together if you own multiple products.</div>
            </li>
        </ol>

            <li>
                <span class="question">How much does it cost to buy more credits?</span>
                <div class="answer">You can purchase additional capacity packs, which are sold in <span class="highlight">1,000-credit</span> monthly units at a price of <span class="highlight">$10 per pack</span> in USD.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">What happens if I use more credits than I have?</span>
                <div class="answer">If your usage exceeds your total credits, your account will either automatically upgrade to include the necessary number of additional capacity packs, or, if you have enabled it, you will incur per-credit overage fees at the end of the month. Note that capacity packs, once added, persist through the end of your term, while per-credit overages are billed only for the month in which they occur.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">What is a "capacity pack"?</span>
                <div class="answer">A "capacity pack" is a purchase that adds <span class="highlight">1,000 additional HubSpot Credits</span> to your account per month. This is the default auto-upgrade path for exceeding your credit limit, with the alternative being the optional per-credit overage system.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">What is the "per-credit overage" option?</span>
                <div class="answer">This is an optional billing method you can enable <em>instead of</em> automatically upgrading with capacity packs. It bills you monthly for each credit used beyond your included amount at a rate of <span class="highlight">$0.010 per credit</span> in USD. Invoices are issued in increments of 10 credits.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">What is a "Breeze Agent"?</span>
                <div class="answer">A <strong>Breeze Agent</strong> is a specialized, autonomous AI worker that executes specific tasks independently. Agents work in the background to save time and uncover opportunities, and are capable of handling complex, multi-step processes automatically without constant oversight.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">Which specific Breeze features consume credits?</span>
                <div class="answer">According to the confirmed rate sheet, features in the following categories consume credits: <strong>Breeze Agents</strong>, <strong>Breeze Automation</strong>, and <strong>Buyer Intent</strong>.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">How much does a single handled conversation with the Customer Agent cost in credits?</span>
                <div class="answer">A single handled conversation on <strong>text-based channels</strong> with the <strong>Customer Agent</strong> costs <span class="highlight">100 credits</span>.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">What is the credit cost for a Breeze action in a workflow?</span>
                <div class="answer">Executing one Breeze action in a workflow costs <span class="highlight">10 credits</span>.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">Are all Breeze AI tools billed using credits?</span>
                <div class="answer">No. While some <strong>Breeze Agents</strong> consume credits, other Breeze features, such as the <strong>Breeze Assistant</strong>, are included in the pricing for the products they are packaged in. Additionally, many agents currently in Beta do not yet have a published credit rate.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">What are HubSpot Seats and how are they different from Credits?</span>
                <div class="answer">A <strong>"seat"</strong> defines the level of access an individual user has to the subscription services and its features. In contrast, <strong>"credits"</strong> are used to purchase additional capacity for specific usage-based features across the platform.</div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">Where can I find the official credit costs for different actions?</span>
                <div class="answer">The <a href="https://knowledge.hubspot.com/account-management/understand-hubspot-credits-and-billing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="faq-rate-sheet"><strong>HubSpot Credits Rate Sheet</strong></span></a> is the authoritative source for this information.

        <h2>Practical Application and Management</h2>
        
        <div class="section-intro">
            Moving from "what" to "how," this section focuses on the practical application of Breeze AI and credits. Here, we cover cost calculation, the mechanics of credit consumption, and step-by-step processes for some of the most popular autonomous agents.
        </div>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <span class="question">How do I calculate the total monthly cost if my usage exceeds my included credits?</span>
                <div class="answer">
                    There are two methods for calculating costs, depending on your account configuration. Let <span class="code">U</span> be your Total Monthly Usage, and <span class="code">I</span> be your Included Credits.
                    
                    <div class="formula">
                        <strong>Auto-Upgrading with Capacity Packs:</strong><br>
                        1. Calculate overage credits: Overage = U - I<br>
                        2. Determine packs needed (rounded up): Packs = ⌈Overage / 1000⌉<br>
                        3. Calculate final cost: Monthly Cost = Packs × $10
                    </div>

                        1. Calculate overage credits: Overage = U - I<br>
                        2. Calculate final cost: Monthly Cost = Overage × $0.010
                    </div>

                <div class="answer">
                    <div class="nested-list">
                        <strong>Per Action:</strong> These features consume credits each time a specific event occurs. For example, a credit charge is applied for each conversation a Customer Agent handles or each time a Breeze action executes in a workflow.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Per Recurrence:</strong> These features consume credits upon activation and then again on a monthly basis for as long as the feature remains enabled.

                </div>

            <li>
                <span class="question">How does the Prospecting Agent work, and what actions consume credits?</span>
                <div class="answer">
                    The Prospecting Agent automates the lead research and outreach process through the following steps:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automatically scans your CRM for contacts matching target criteria</li>
                        <li>Researches contacts using public data, social media, and company websites</li>
                        <li>Analyzes recent company news, funding, and hiring patterns</li>
                        <li>Generates detailed multi-page research reports broken into sections like founders, recent news, web traffic, and organic keywords</li>
                        <li>Crafts personalized email sequences based on research findings</li>
                        <li>Schedules and sends outreach emails at optimal times</li>
                        <li>Monitors responses and adjusts follow-ups automatically</li>
                        <li>Updates CRM records with all engagement data</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    This agent has two actions that consume credits:
                    <div class="nested-list">
                        • <span class="highlight">100 credits</span> to enable monthly monitoring of one contact<br>

                    </div>
                </div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="question">Can you provide a step-by-step example of the Customer Agent's support process?</span>
                <div class="answer">

                <div class="answer">
                    Breeze Agents are designed to work in the background to uncover opportunities by analyzing patterns in your customer data. Key methods include:
                    
                    <div class="nested-list">
                        <strong>Intent Signal Detection:</strong> Agents can track when target accounts visit high-intent pages (like pricing or demos) or show increased activity (like hiring or funding), signaling they are ready to buy.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Revenue Expansion Opportunities:</strong> By analyzing support tickets and product usage patterns, agents can identify customers who are approaching plan limits or asking about capabilities beyond their current plan, flagging them for upsell or cross-sell conversations.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Pipeline Acceleration Opportunities:</strong> Agents can identify key decision-makers who are not yet engaged in a deal, track which prospects are actively consuming sales materials, and recognize when multiple meetings are being booked, all of which provide insights to help close deals faster.

                <div class="answer">The primary advantage is <strong>connected data on a unified platform</strong>. Because Breeze AI is built into HubSpot, it can leverage the full customer context—from marketing interactions and website visits to sales calls and service tickets. This creates a single source of truth, allowing AI to uncover patterns and deliver insights that are impossible to see in a disorganized tech stack with standalone tools operating on fragmented data.</div>

                <div class="answer">For volatile workloads or short-term usage spikes, the recommended operational approach is to <strong>enable per-credit overages with a spend cap</strong>. This method allows you to pay only for what you use during a spike. It avoids committing to persistent capacity pack upgrades, which are a recurring monthly cost that remains through your subscription term even if usage decreases in subsequent months.</div>
