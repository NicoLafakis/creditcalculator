### Pricing Overview

Pricing for HubSpot’s products varies by product and can be referenced within each individual product section in this catalog. In general, products are available through the purchase of HubSpot Seats, which grant individual users access to specific features. With HubSpot Credits, you can also purchase additional capacity for certain features. Learn more about the different types of HubSpot Seats and HubSpot Credits below.

### HubSpot Seats

A “seat” is the manner and level of access your users have to the subscription services. We offer different types of seats based on which subscription services you purchase.

Core Seats: A “Core Seat” for our paid subscriptions provides a user with access to the features and tools in the subscription, including Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub, Content Hub, and Data Hub.

* Core Seats (Starter): Core Seats (Starter) can be used to access the features available in Starter subscriptions, including Marketing Hub Starter, Sales Hub Starter, Service Hub Starter, Content Hub Starter, and Data Hub Starter.  
* Core Seats (Professional): Core Seats (Professional) can be used to access the features available in Professional subscriptions, including Marketing Hub Professional, Content Hub Professional, and Data Hub Professional. Customers with Core Seats (Professional) may access some functionality of the Sales Hub Professional Seat or Service Hub Professional products; however, full Sales Hub Professional and Service Hub Professional functionality is only accessible with a Sales Hub Professional Seat or Service Hub Professional Seat, respectively.  
* Core Seats (Enterprise): Core Seats (Enterprise) can be used to access the features available in Enterprise subscriptions, including Marketing Hub Enterprise, Content Hub Enterprise, and Data Hub Enterprise. Customers with Sales Hub Enterprise and Service Hub Enterprise subscriptions may access some functionality of those products with a Core Seat (Enterprise); however, full Sales Hub Enterprise and Service Hub Enterprise functionality is only accessible with a Sales Hub Enterprise Seat or Service Hub Enterprise Seat, respectively. Customers with an Enterprise subscription may purchase additional Core Seats (Enterprise) at any time.

**Sales Seat:** A “Sales Seat” provides a user with access to Sales Hub and access to advanced features for Sales Hub Professional and Sales Hub Enterprise. Sales Seat functionality also includes Core Seat access to your purchased Marketing Hub, Content Hub, and Data Hub subscription(s), including any other features purchased and included in your subscription services. Customers with Professional and Enterprise subscription services may purchase additional Sales Seats at any time. Starter customers can access Sales Hub with Core Seats (Starter), as detailed in the Core Seats (Starter) description above.

**Service Seat:** A “Service Seat” provides a user with access to Service Hub and access to advanced features for Professional and Enterprise subscription editions. Service Seat functionality also includes Core Seat access to your purchased Marketing Hub, Content Hub, and Data Hub subscription(s), including any other features purchased and included in your subscription services. Customers with Professional and Enterprise subscription services may purchase additional Service Seats at any time. Starter customers can access Service Hub with Core Seats (Starter), as detailed in the Core Seats (Starter) description above.

**Commerce Seat:** A “Commerce Seat” provides a user with access to Commerce Hub and access to advanced features for Professional and Enterprise subscription editions. Commerce Seat functionality also includes Core Seat access to your purchased Marketing Hub, Content Hub, and Data Hub subscription(s), including any other features purchased and included in your subscription services. Customers with Professional and Enterprise subscription services may purchase additional Commerce Seats at any time. Customers with free subscriptions may access some functionality of Commerce Hub; however, full Commerce Hub functionality is only accessible with a Commerce Seat.

View-Only Seats: A “View-Only Seat” allows a user to view the subscription services without making any changes to their account. Users with View-Only Seats may view records, dashboards, and other customer data; this includes viewing and filtering reports, but not saving reports. Users with View-Only Seats do not have the ability to create, publish, edit, or delete information in their account. Therefore, View-Only Seats cannot be used by your admin or super admin users. View-Only Seats are exclusively available to Starter, Professional, and Enterprise customers at no additional cost and are unlimited.  

Mixed-Tier Customers: If you have a mix of Starter, Professional, and/or Enterprise subscription services, all Core Seats will have the highest level of access and features across your purchased subscription services and will be priced based on the highest level of your subscription services. For example, if a customer has Marking Hub Enterprise and Content Hub Professional, all Core Seats will have access to Enterprise-level features for Marketing Hub, Professional-level features for Content Hub, and the highest level of access to all other platform-wide features; all Core Seats will be priced at the Enterprise price point.

Partner Seats: If you work with a HubSpot Solutions Partner, you may add “Partner Seats” at no additional cost to you.  You agree to grant or confirm a Partner Seat exclusively for HubSpot Solutions Partners you’re actively working with and who need this access to perform services in your subscription services; HubSpot will confirm, deny, or remove Partner Seats in our sole, reasonable discretion. You will notify us promptly of any unauthorized use of Partner Seats by following the instructions at [https://help.hubspot.com](https://help.hubspot.com/). You can learn more about our Solutions Partners in the HubSpot Solutions Directory at [https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/solutions](https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/solutions). Partner Seats are available to both HubSpot Solutions Providers and HubSpot Solution Partners.

For information on how to manage users in seats or decrease the number of any seat type added to your HubSpot account, please review the “HubSpot Seats” section of the [Product Specific Terms](https://legal.hubspot.com/product-specific-terms), as well as the [HubSpot user permissions](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/user-management/hubspot-user-permissions-guide) knowledge base article.  

### HubSpot Credits

HubSpot Credits are a simple, flexible way to pay for what you use. Credits work across all usage-based features and give you a clear way to manage and plan your usage each month. Your HubSpot Credits reset monthly during your subscription term. Unused credits do not roll over into the following month. 

Some HubSpot products include HubSpot Credits at no additional cost. Included credits are not additive across products. Customers with multiple products will receive the highest available credit allotment based on their highest-level product edition. For example, if you’re subscribed to both Marketing Hub Professional and Sales Hub Enterprise, your highest-level product edition would be Enterprise.

#### Smart CRM, Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub, Content Hub

| HIGHEST-LEVEL PRODUCT EDITION | INCLUDED HUBSPOT CREDITS |
| :---- | ----- |
| Starter | 500 |
| Professional | 3,000 |
| Enterprise | 5,000 |

If you’re subscribed to Data Hub or Customer Platform\*, the following included HubSpot Credit quantities are applicable. For example, if you’re subscribed to both Marketing Hub Professional and Data Hub Professional, you will get 5,000 included HubSpot Credits. 

#### Data Hub, Customer Platform\*

| HIGHEST-LEVEL PRODUCT EDITION | INCLUDED HUBSPOT CREDITS |
| :---- | ----- |
| Starter | 500 |
| Professional | 5,000 |
| Enterprise | 10,000 |

\*Customer Platform includes the Starter, Professional, or Enterprise edition of every HubSpot product, bundled together.

You may purchase additional capacity packs at the rates set forth below by:

* Adding additional capacity packs to your account during checkout, or  
* Exceeding the number of credits in your account after purchasing credits.

| ADDITIONAL HUBSPOT CREDITS CAPACITY PACK | PRICING |
| :---- | ----- |
| 1,000 credits/month | $10 per additional capacity pack |

If your usage exceeds the total credits in your account, your account will automatically upgrade to include additional HubSpot Credits capacity packs that reflect your usage. You’ll be charged a prorated amount for the remainder of the current billing period. Your account will reflect the additional capacity packs through the end of your current term, even if your usage decreases. You can remove added capacity packs at your next renewal by signing a new order form. 

Alternatively, you can choose to turn on credit overages for your account instead of automatically upgrading to include additional HubSpot Credits capacity packs that reflect usage. If you choose to turn on overages, and if your usage exceeds the total credits in your account, you will incur additional fees at the rates provided in the “Overage Price Per Credit” table based on your usage. We will issue an invoice for any overages in increments of 10 credits at the end of each month of your subscription term, and you will remain at the original committed credit capacity. You can learn more about overages [here](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/account-management/understand-hubspot-credits-and-billing).

Once you configure your account for additional HubSpot Credits, you can set a maximum monthly limit to stay within your budget. When purchasing additional credits, we may also implement technical limits for security and fraud protections.

#### Overage Price Per Credit

| USD | AUD | CAD | COP | EUR | GBP | INR | JPY | SGD |
| :---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0.010 | 0.014 | 0.013 | 30 | 0.010 | 0.009 | 0.84 | 1.20 | 0.014 |

HubSpot Credits are consumed based on the features you use and the rates outlined in the HubSpot Credits Rate Sheet below.

#### HubSpot Credits Rate Sheet

The HubSpot Credits Rate Sheet lists the credits used for individual features and actions to help you estimate your usage. Features may consume credits in two ways: 

* Per action, meaning features generating outputs at the time of request use credits as listed actions occur.  
* Per recurrence, meaning features with recurring outputs use credits both upon activation, and monthly for the remainder of your subscription term so long as the feature is enabled. Please note, features supporting recurring outputs may consume credits at the amount(s) reflected in the HubSpot Credits Rate Sheet on different days during the month based on your account configuration.  

Credits consumed by actions in the rate sheet may also be subject to other applicable service charges. For example, an agent feature uses credits, but it may also consume telephony minutes or SMS messages required by those services at additional service charges.

Some automated, bulk, and high-volume features consume credits at a faster rate, which may accelerate overall credit usage.

##### Breeze Agents

| Prospecting agent | Enable monthly monitoring of one contact for outreach opportunities | 100 |

#### **Beta Features**

We're committed to bringing you innovation as quickly as possible, which is why we provide access to cutting-edge beta features that can help grow your business before they launch. Beta features may or may not consume credits, and we may adjust credit rates during the beta period for beta features.

To balance our commitment to rapid innovation with transparency, we aim to provide at least 30 days' notice before beta features start to consume credits, though this may not always be possible due to the speed and nature of beta development. As a reminder, the [HubSpot Beta Services Terms](https://legal.hubspot.com/hubspot-beta-terms) included in your agreement apply to features in beta.

### Marketing Hub

HubSpot’s marketing automation software is designed to help you generate leads and automate marketing to drive growth. It offers the tools you need to increase revenue through high-quality leads, save time and resources, and measure and optimize campaigns — all on one powerful, easy-to-use platform. Marketing Hub is available in three editions — Starter, Professional, and Enterprise — with select functionality in our free tools.

Pricing

For new customers after March 5, 2024, Marketing Hub is priced per seat at the Starter edition, and starts at a base price for the Professional and Enterprise editions. For existing customers, the pricing model for your subscription(s) won’t be affected at this time, and you’ll stay on your current pricing model unless and until we contact you. Pricing also varies based on the number and type of contacts in your database.

As a reminder, customers after Oct. 21, 2020 will automatically have access to Marketing Hub \- Marketing Contacts pricing as part of their subscription. Pre-existing customers may still have access to [legacy contacts pricing](https://www.hubspot.com/hubspot-product-and-services-catalog/legacy-marketing-hub-contact-pricing) until they migrate to the new Marketing Hub \- Marketing Contacts pricing.

Types of Contacts:

* Marketing Contacts: Marketing contacts can be sent marketing emails and be targeted with ads manually or with automation if it’s included in your subscription.  
* Non-Marketing Contacts: Non-marketing contacts cannot be sent marketing emails and cannot be targeted with ads. 

You can designate contacts as marketing contacts at any time, and your changes will take effect immediately. You can also designate contacts as non-marketing contacts at any time. However, those changes will take effect only at the start of the following month or your contract renewal date — whichever comes first — and your contact tier pricing cannot be downgraded until your contract renewal date. If you exceed your marketing contacts tier at any time, you will be billed immediately. The fee for marketing contacts is a blended rate based on the number of contacts purchased and the applicable rates.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### If I subscribe to Marketing Hub and use HubSpot's free tools, what's my technical contact limit in the HubSpot contacts database?

We will honor the higher limit and the tools run off of the same underlying database. That means if you subscribe to Marketing Hub and HubSpot's free tools, you could have up to 15 million objects, and contacts count as an ‘object’ in the HubSpot contacts database. If you purchase CRM Contact Record Limit Increase, you can increase your contacts database up to a maximum of 50 million contact object records. Remember that if you use HubSpot's free tools with Marketing Hub, the contacts you add to your contacts database end up in both places and could affect your contact tier pricing.

### Do I have to pay for contacts?

Yes, if you subscribe to Marketing Hub. While there’s no charge for contacts you add to the free contacts database, if you subscribe to Marketing Hub \- Marketing Contacts, you will be charged for marketing contacts as part of your fee for that product, even if they are added to the free contacts database. You will not be charged for non-marketing contacts. If you subscribe to legacy Marketing Hub, please visit [this page](https://www.hubspot.com/hubspot-product-and-services-catalog/legacy-marketing-hub-contact-pricing) for details.

### Where can I find more information about what these API limits mean?

You can find more information about our APIs and the limits that apply to them through our [API Documentation](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/overview), including our [API Usage Guidelines](https://developers.hubspot.com/apps/api_guidelines).

### Are there any separate email sending fees?

No. Your email send limit is based on the number of contacts you purchase. For Marketing Hub \- Marketing Contacts Starter, your email send limit is 5 times per contact per calendar month; for Marketing Hub \- Marketing Contacts Professional, your email send limit is 10 times your contact tier per calendar month; and for Marketing Hub \- Marketing Contacts Enterprise, your email send limit is 20 times your contact tier per calendar month. Email send limits for legacy Marketing Hub customers are described on [this page](https://www.hubspot.com/hubspot-product-and-services-catalog/legacy-marketing-hub-contact-pricing). If you need to send even more than that, you can purchase the Dedicated IP Add-On for unlimited email sends.

### If I purchase two products that include the same features, does that mean the limits are additive? For example, if I subscribe to Sales Hub Professional and Service Hub Professional, which each include up to 3,000 minutes of calling per account per month, do I get up to 6,000 minutes of calling per account per month?

No. Limits are not additive across Hubs. So, in cases where a HubSpot account has more than one paid Hub with shared features, the upper limits listed in the tables above still apply. This means in the example of the calling feature in Sales Hub Professional and Service Hub Professional, the limit would be an aggregate of 3,000 minutes of calling per account per month. (Exceptions to this, which are additive, are: i) primary subdomains provided per content type, as we describe in the ‘Technical Limits’ above, and ii) audiences and ad spend if purchasing units of the Ads Add-On.)

### I’m subscribed to Marketing and/or Service Hub and want to use the SMS functionality. How are “message segments” counted in the add-ons and limit increases for SMS?

[According to Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-sms-character-limit#:~:text=Large%20messages%20are%20split%20into,to%20ensure%20correct%20re%2Dassembly.), which provides the underlying functionality for HubSpot’s SMS tool, when you send an SMS message containing more than 160 characters, the message is split into smaller messages for transmission. Large messages are split into 153-character "segments" and sent individually, then re-assembled by the recipient’s device. The effective character limit per segment is 153 rather than 160, because a data header must be included with each segment to ensure correct re-assembly.

For example, a 161-character message will be sent as two messages: one with 153 characters and a second with eight characters.

If you include [non-GSM-7 characters](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-gsm-7-character-encoding), such as emojis, those messages will be sent using the [UCS-2](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-ucs-2-character-encoding) encoding. Messages containing one or more UCS-2 characters can only contain up to 70 characters in a single, non-segmented message. UCS-2 messages of more than 70 characters will be split into 67-character segments.

You can view the number of message segments you have consumed in your SMS settings at any time.
